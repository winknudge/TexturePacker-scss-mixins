ScSS mixins exporter (not SASS) for Texture Packer
========================

## Experimental Version ##

Working on an advanced version that can suffix -hi-res or -standard-res onto mixins 

e.g.

- @include sprite-name<b>-hi-res</b>;
- @include sprite-name<b>-standard-res</b>;


This is triggered by a change in the scale (variations)

<   --variant 1:-hi-res --variant 0.76:-standard-res   >
